	look<br>
	you made it to the bathroom!<br>
	<br>
	this is peppa and her friend<br>
	my dad got them for me this christmas<br>
	and i dont know why<br>
	<br>
	i like to put them around the place<br>
	a guest told me they're cringe<br>
	<br>
	HELLO?!<br>
	i think theyre adorable<br>
	also who decided they're cringe?<br>
	if there's anything ive learned from<br>
	trying to be cool and edgy as a teenager<br>
	is that it's better to just be cringe<br>
	i'm happy being cringe<br>
	<br>
	because then i'm at least sincere<br>
	i want to be around sincere people<br>
	don't you<br>
	so why are you trying to be someone you're not<br>
	and put me down for it?
