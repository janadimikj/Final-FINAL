	these are collages my roommate put up<br>
	they're not only cute<br>
	they also make me existential<br>
	<br>
	why did she put "grief"?<br>
	what makes a "ladie"?<br>
	<br>
	the "ladie" gets me<br>
	sometimes i feel insecure in my "ladieness"<br>
	everyone i see looks a lot better than me<br>
	a lot more ladie<br>
	and i'm a hermit<br>
	<br>
	thank you instagram,<br>
	thank you so much!<br>
	do i have to post the most boring pic of myself<br>
	do have people tell me i'm<br>
	pretty<br>
	hot<br>
	amazing<br>
	<br>
	fuck off i know it's not genuine<br>
	because even i do that and just scroll right past<br>
	why is that so built in to us?
