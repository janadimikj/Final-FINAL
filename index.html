	<p>hello <br>
	how are you?<br>
	i'm good today, but this site has been killing me.<br>
	<br>
	to start, i would like to give you some context.<br>
	pls press the images in color to reveal text<br>
	if you're bored and want to move on to the next part of the room, press "next". <br>
	<br>
	in this project, i will show you different parts of my room.<br>
	and while you look around you will discover little stories<br>
	but more importantly, insight into why i so openly am showing you my place like this<br>
	<br>
	enjoy!
