	this is gyatto<br>
	my girlfriend and i went to target after dorm move-in<br>
	to get little things<br>
	because we have material urges<br>
	<br>
	so we got squishmallows together<br>
	while at target<br>
	we saw an influencer we both knew<br>
	<br>
	how do influencers become famous?<br>
	what is it about this 20-something-year-old film student<br>
	that has us acting like we saw beyonce?<br>
	<br>
	in reality, none of our friends even knew who this is<br>
	because they don't watch lesbian sonny angel influencers<br>
	<br>
	but seriously why do we have influencers?<br>
	as if i need to be influenced to buy more things<br>
	bc this pretty girl has it<br>
	it all comes back to money
