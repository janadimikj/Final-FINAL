	when i landed in nyc my phone was dead<br>
	i needed to get to carroll gardens<br>
	how tf do you get there from newark<br>
	<br>
	i asked the woman at the information desk<br>
	she said: uber<br>
	i said: maam that's a lot of money<br>
	she said: you? subway? and looked me up and down<br>
	<br>
	yes. me. train. please?<br>
	she showed me the route on this map<br>
	and i was not paying attention<br>
	<br>
	the thought that went in my brain was<br>
	wow, isn't this aesthetic<br>
	this is great nyc instagram post<br>
	<br>
	no girl you need to get home<br>
	<br>
	i ended up taking a bus to times square<br>
	and hailing a cab<br>
