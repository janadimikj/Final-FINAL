	i like to get memorabilia from decisive moments and places<br>
	this animated movie luca, i've watched too many times<br>
	<br>
	the second time i watched it was out on the lit up courtyard<br>
	with my friend in florence<br>
	i just let the mosquitoes eat me alive<br>
	my friend got a call and i paused the movie<br>
	<br>
	her aunt said: hey nicole, the queen is dead<br>
	<br>
	we let the movie play again<br>
	but also watched tiktoks at the same time now<br>
	about the queen reincarnating as trisha paytas' baby<br>
	<br>
	is it bad my first reaction to her death was to laugh?<br>
	everything is a meme now<br>
	have i become desensitized to real things?
