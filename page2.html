	i feel like i need to prove myself on the internet<br>
	but what do i have to prove<br>
	<br>
	this is my favorite mug because it's moomin<br>
	moomin have a special place in my heart<br>
	because i'd watch them every morning<br>
	<br>
	i don't remember the theme song<br>
	but i do remember the meme version of it:<br>
	<br>
	muumi troll and little my<br>
	squashed under the car<br>
	skull flies to the field<br>
	intestines to the bottom of the ditch<br>
	muumi dad goes to get drunk<br>
	<br>
	the last two lines often varied<br>
	either way they were something graphic<br>
	this is the first meme i remember<br>
	and it's stuck in my head every day
